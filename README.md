# DisplayApi

## OpenAPI specification

The OpenAPI specification is committed to this repo as `public/api-spec-v1.yaml`
and as `public/api-spec-v1.json`.

A CI check will compare the current API implementation to the spec. If they
are different the check will fail.

If a PR makes _planned_ changes to the spec, the commited file must be updated:

```shell
docker compose exec phpfpm composer update-api-spec
```

If these are _breaking_ changes the API version must be changed accordingly.

## Stateless

The API is stateless except `/v1/authentication` routes.
Make sure to set the `CORS_ALLOW_ORIGIN` correctly in `.env.local`.

## Development Setup

A `docker-compose.yml` file with a PHP 8.0 image is included in this project.
To install the dependencies you can run

```shell
docker compose up -d
docker compose exec phpfpm composer install

# Run migrations
docker compose exec phpfpm bin/console doctrine:migrations:migrate

# Load fixtures (Optional)
docker compose exec phpfpm bin/console hautelook:fixtures:load --no-interaction
```

The fixtures have an admin user: <john@example.com> with the password: apassword
The fixtures have an editor user: <hans@editor.com> with the password: apassword
The fixtures have the image-text template, and two screen layouts:
full screen and "two boxes".

## OIDC providers

At the present two possible oidc providers are implemented: 'internal' and 'external'.
These work differently.
The internal provider is expected to handle both authentication and authorization. Any users logging in through the internal will be granted access based on the tenants/roles provided. 

The external provider only handles authentication. A user logging in through the external provider will not be granted access automatically, but will be challenged to enter an activation (invite) code to verify access. 
### Internal

The internal oidc provider gets that user's name, email and tenants from claims.

The claim keys needed are set in the env variables:

- INTERNAL_OIDC_CLAIM_NAME
- INTERNAL_OIDC_CLAIM_EMAIL
- INTERNAL_OIDC_CLAIM_GROUPS

### External

The external oidc provider takes only the claim defined in the env variable
OIDC_EXTERNAL_CLAIM_ID, hashes it and uses this hash as providerId for the user.
When a user logs in with this provider, it is initially not in any tenant.
To be added to a tenant the user has to use an activation code a
ROLE_EXTERNAL_USER_ADMIN has created.

## JWT Auth

To authenticate against the API locally you must generate a private/public key pair:

```shell
docker compose exec phpfpm bin/console lexik:jwt:generate-keypair
```

Then create a local test user if needed:

```shell
docker compose exec phpfpm bin/console app:user:add
```

You can now obtain a token by sending a `POST` request to the
`/authentication/token` endpoint:

```curl
curl -X 'POST' \
  'http://displayapiservice.local.itkdev.dk/v1/authentication/token' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
  "email": "test@test.com",
  "password": "testtest"
}'
```

Either on the command line or through the OpenApi docs at `/docs`

You can use the token either by clicking "Authorize" in the docs and entering

```curl
Bearer <token>
```

as the api key value. Or by adding an auth header to your requests

```curl
curl -X 'GET' \
  'http://displayapiservice.local.itkdev.dk/v1/layouts?page=1&itemsPerPage=10' \
  -H 'accept: application/ld+json' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <token>'
```

### Psalm static analysis

[Psalm](https://psalm.dev/) is used for static analysis. To run
psalm do

```shell
docker compose exec phpfpm composer install
docker compose exec phpfpm ./vendor/bin/psalm
```

Psalm [error level](https://psalm.dev/docs/running_psalm/error_levels/) is set
to level 2.

### Composer normalizer

[Composer normalize](https://github.com/ergebnis/composer-normalize) is used for
formatting `composer.json`

```shell
docker compose exec phpfpm composer normalize
```

### Check Coding Standard

The following command let you test that the code follows
the coding standard for the project.

- PHP files [PHP Coding Standards Fixer](https://cs.symfony.com/)

    ```shell
    docker compose exec phpfpm composer coding-standards-check
    ```

- Markdown files (markdownlint standard rules)

    ```shell
    docker run -v .:/app --workdir=/app node:18 npm install
    docker run -v .:/app --workdir=/app node:18 npm run check-coding-standards
    ```

### Apply Coding Standards

To attempt to automatically fix coding style issues

- PHP files [PHP Coding Standards Fixer](https://cs.symfony.com/)

    ```sh
    docker compose exec phpfpm composer coding-standards-apply
    ```

- Markdown files (markdownlint standard rules)

    ```shell
    docker run -v .:/app --workdir=/app node:18 npm install
    docker run -v .:/app --workdir=/app node:18 npm run apply-coding-standards
    ```

## CI

Github Actions are used to run the test suite and code style checks on all PRs.

If you wish to test against the jobs locally you can install [act](https://github.com/nektos/act).
Then do:

```shell
act -P ubuntu-latest=shivammathur/node:latest pull_request
```
