docker compose exec phpfpm composer install
```

### Psalm static analysis

[Psalm](https://psalm.dev/) is used for static analysis. To run
psalm do

docker compose exec phpfpm composer install
docker compose exec phpfpm ./vendor/bin/psalm
```

Psalm [error level](https://psalm.dev/docs/running_psalm/error_levels/) is set
to level 2.

### Check Coding Standard

The following command let you test that the code follows
the coding standard for the project.

* PHP files [PHP Coding Standards Fixer](https://cs.symfony.com/)

    ```shell
    docker compose exec phpfpm composer check-coding-standards
    ```

* Markdown files (markdownlint standard rules)

    ```shell
    docker run -v ${PWD}:/app itkdev/yarn:latest install
    docker run -v ${PWD}:/app itkdev/yarn:latest check-coding-standards
    ```

### Apply Coding Standards

To attempt to automatically fix coding style issues

* PHP files [PHP Coding Standards Fixer](https://cs.symfony.com/)

    ```sh
    docker compose exec phpfpm composer apply-coding-standards
    ```

* Markdown files (markdownlint standard rules)

    ```shell

    docker run -v ${PWD}:/app itkdev/yarn:latest apply-coding-standards
    ```

## CI

Github Actions are used to run the test suite and code style checks on all PRs.

If you wish to test against the jobs locally you can install [act](https://github.com/nektos/act).
